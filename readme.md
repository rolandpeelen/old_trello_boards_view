# What is this?

Sometimes things are an improvement and sometimes they are not. I'm not a big fan of Trello's new layout, I don't want my productivity made into some social media feed.
As such, I build this (tiny) css overriding chrome extension.

## Reminder

Please make sure to enable it only after clicking the boards view once. After that, Trello will open in that board view by default. I have no built in way to revert the setting or set the other one. Just disable the extension temporarily if you want to get back.

# How to install?

I'm looking into getting it into the chrome store. For now, just install it manually by going to: chrome://extensions/
